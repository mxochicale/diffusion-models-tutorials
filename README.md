# :school_satchel: :wrench: Having a go to diffusion probabilistic models
> Diffusion probabilistic models are a class of latent variable models, e.g. Markov chains trained using variational inference. [~wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_model)

See [jupyter notebooks](tutorials/), [mnist-like datasets](datasets), [`*.gif` animations](tutorials/results), models and few [references](references).  
This repo should be fairly reproducible, see python version and its packages, OS version, GPU version and other [details](dependencies).
